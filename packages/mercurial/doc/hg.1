.TP
.B \fBadd [OPTION]... [FILE]...\fP
.sp
Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the
repository.
.sp
The files will be added to the repository at the next commit. To
undo an add before that, see hg forget.
.sp
If no names are given, add all files to the repository.
.sp
An example showing how new (unknown) files are added
automatically by \fBhg add\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ ls
foo.c
$ hg status
? foo.c
$ hg add
adding foo.c
$ hg status

.TP
.B \-X,  \-\-exclude
.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBaddremove [OPTION]... [FILE]...\fP
.sp
Add all new files and remove all missing files from the
repository.
.sp
New files are ignored if they match any of the patterns in
.hgignore. As with add, these changes take effect at the next
commit.
.sp
Use the \-s/\-\-similarity option to detect renamed files. With a
parameter greater than 0, this compares every removed file with
every added file and records those similar enough as renames. This
option takes a percentage between 0 (disabled) and 100 (files must
be identical) as its parameter. Detecting renamed files this way
can be expensive.
.sp
options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-s,  \-\-similarity
.
guess renamed files by similarity (0<=s<=100)
.TP
.B \-I,  \-\-include
.
include names matching the given patterns
.TP
.B \-X,  \-\-exclude
.
exclude names matching the given patterns

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBannotate [\-r REV] [\-f] [\-a] [\-u] [\-d] [\-n] [\-c] [\-l] FILE...\fP
.sp
List changes in files, showing the revision id responsible for
each line
.sp
This command is useful for discovering when a change was made and
by whom.
.sp
Without the \-a/\-\-text option, annotate will avoid processing files
it detects as binary. With \-a, annotate will annotate the file
anyway, although the results will probably be neither useful
nor desirable.
.sp
options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-r,  \-\-rev
.
annotate the specified revision
.TP
.B \-\-follow
.

.TP
.B \fBarchive [OPTION]... DEST\fP
.sp
By default, the revision used is the parent of the working
directory; use \-r/\-\-rev to specify a different revision.
.sp
To specify the type of archive to create, use \-t/\-\-type. Valid
types are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBfiles\fP
.sp
a directory full of files (default)
.TP
.B \fBtar\fP
.sp
tar archive, uncompressed
.TP
.B \fBtbz2\fP
.sp
tar archive, compressed using bzip2
.TP
.B \fBtgz\fP
.sp
tar archive, compressed using gzip
.TP
.B \fBuzip\fP
.sp
zip archive, uncompressed
.TP
.B \fBzip\fP
.sp
zip archive, compressed using deflate
.UNINDENT
.sp
The exact name of the destination archive or directory is given
using a format string; see \(aqhg help export\(aq for details.
.sp
Each member added to an archive file has a directory prefix
prepended. Use \-p/\-\-prefix to specify a format string for the
prefix. The default is the basename of the archive, with suffixes
removed.
.sp
options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-decode
.
do not pass files through decoders
.TP
.B \-p,  \-\-prefix
.
directory prefix for files in archive
.TP

.TP
.B \-t,  \-\-type
.
type of distribution to create
.TP
.B \-I,  \-\-include
.
include names matching the given patterns
.TP

.
exclude names matching the given patterns
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBbackout [OPTION]... [\-r] REV\fP
.sp
Commit the backed out changes as a new changeset. The new
changeset is a child of the backed out changeset.
.sp
If you backout a changeset other than the tip, a new head is
created. This head will be the new tip and you should merge this
backout changeset with another head.
.sp
The \-\-merge option remembers the parent of the working directory
before starting the backout, then merges the new head with that
changeset afterwards. This saves you from doing the merge by hand.
The result of this merge is not committed, as with a normal merge.
.sp
See \(aqhg help dates\(aq for a list of formats valid for \-d/\-\-date.
.sp
options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-\-merge
.
merge with old dirstate parent after backout
.TP
.B \-\-parent
.
parent to choose when backing out merge
.TP
.B \-r,  \-\-rev
.

.TP
.B \-I,  \-\-include
.
include names matching the given patterns
.TP
.B \-X,  \-\-exclude
.
exclude names matching the given patterns
.TP
.B \-m,  \-\-message
.
use <text> as commit message
.TP
.B \-l,  \-\-logfile
.

.TP
.B \fBbisect [\-gbsr] [\-U] [\-c CMD] [REV]\fP
.sp
This command helps to find changesets which introduce problems. To
use, mark the earliest changeset you know exhibits the problem as
bad, then mark the latest changeset which is free from the problem
as good. Bisect will update your working directory to a revision
for testing (unless the \-U/\-\-noupdate option is specified). Once
you have performed tests, mark the working directory as good or
bad, and bisect will either update to another candidate changeset
or announce that it has found the bad revision.
.sp
As a shortcut, you can also use the revision argument to mark a
revision as good or bad without checking it out first.
.sp
If you supply a command, it will be used for automatic bisection.
Its exit status will be used to mark revisions as good or bad:
status 0 means good, 125 means to skip the revision, 127
(command not found) will abort the bisection, and any other
non\-zero exit status means the revision is bad.
.sp
options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-r,  \-\-reset
.
reset bisect state
.TP
.B \-g,  \-\-good
.
mark changeset good
.TP
.B \-b,  \-\-bad
.
mark changeset bad
.TP
.B \-s,  \-\-skip
.
skip testing changeset
.TP
.B \-c,  \-\-command
.
use command to check changeset state
.TP
.B \-U,  \-\-noupdate
.
do not update to target
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBbranch [\-fC] [NAME]\fP
.sp
With no argument, show the current branch name. With one argument,
set the working directory branch name (the branch will not exist
in the repository until the next commit). Standard practice
recommends that primary development take place on the \(aqdefault\(aq
branch.
.sp
Unless \-f/\-\-force is specified, branch will not let you set a
branch name that already exists, even if it\(aqs inactive.
.sp
Use \-C/\-\-clean to reset the working directory branch to that of
the parent of the working directory, negating a previous branch
change.
.sp
Use the command \(aqhg update\(aq to switch to an existing branch. Use
\(aqhg commit \-\-close\-branch\(aq to mark this branch as closed.
.sp
options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-f,  \-\-force
.
set branch name even if it shadows an existing branch
.TP
.B \-C,  \-\-clean
.
reset branch name to parent branch name
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBbranches [\-ac]\fP
.sp
List the repository\(aqs named branches, indicating which ones are
inactive. If \-c/\-\-closed is specified, also list branches which have
been marked closed (see hg commit \-\-close\-branch).
.sp
If \-a/\-\-active is specified, only show active branches. A branch
is considered active if it contains repository heads.
.sp
Use the command \(aqhg update\(aq to switch to an existing branch.
.sp
options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-a,  \-\-active
.
show only branches that have unmerged heads
.TP
.B \-c,  \-\-closed
.
show normal and closed branches
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBbundle [\-f] [\-t TYPE] [\-a] [\-r REV]... [\-\-base REV]... FILE [DEST]\fP
.sp
Generate a compressed changegroup file collecting changesets not
known to be in another repository.
.sp
If you omit the destination repository, then hg assumes the
destination will have all the nodes you specify with \-\-base
parameters. To create a bundle containing all changesets, use
\-a/\-\-all (or \-\-base null).
.sp
You can change compression method with the \-t/\-\-type option.
The available compression methods are: none, bzip2, and
gzip (by default, bundles are compressed using bzip2).
.sp
The bundle file can then be transferred using conventional means
and applied to another repository with the unbundle or pull
command. This is useful when direct push and pull are not
available or when exporting an entire repository is undesirable.
.sp
Applying bundles preserves all changeset contents including
permissions, copy/rename information, and revision history.
.sp
options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-f,  \-\-force
.
run even when the destination is unrelated
.TP
.B \-r,  \-\-rev
.
a changeset intended to be added to the destination
.TP
.B \-b,  \-\-branch
.
a specific branch you would like to bundle
.TP
.B \-\-base
.
a base changeset assumed to be available at the destination
.TP
.B \-a,  \-\-all
.
bundle all changesets in the repository
.TP
.B \-t,  \-\-type
.
bundle compression type to use (default: bzip2)
.TP
.B \-e,  \-\-ssh
.
specify ssh command to use
.TP
.B \-\-remotecmd
.
specify hg command to run on the remote side
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBcat [OPTION]... FILE...\fP
.sp
Print the specified files as they were at the given revision. If
no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used,
or tip if no revision is checked out.
.sp
Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the file is
given using a format string. The formatting rules are the same as
for the export command, with the following additions:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB%s\fP
.sp
basename of file being printed
.TP
.B \fB%d\fP
.sp
dirname of file being printed, or \(aq.\(aq if in repository root
.TP

.sp
root\-relative path name of file being printed
.UNINDENT

options:
.INDENT 7.0

.TP
.B \-\-decode
.
apply any matching decode filter
.TP
.B \-I,  \-\-include
.
include names matching the given patterns
.TP
.B \-X,  \-\-exclude
.
exclude names matching the given patterns
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBclone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]\fP
.sp
Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.
.sp
If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
basename of the source.
.sp
The location of the source is added to the new repository\(aqs
.hg/hgrc file, as the default to be used for future pulls.
.sp
See \(aqhg help urls\(aq for valid source format details.
.sp
It is possible to specify an \fBssh://\fP URL as the destination, but no
.hg/hgrc and working directory will be created on the remote side.
Please see \(aqhg help urls\(aq for important details about \fBssh://\fP URLs.
.sp
A set of changesets (tags, or branch names) to pull may be specified
by listing each changeset (tag, or branch name) with \-r/\-\-rev.
If \-r/\-\-rev is used, the cloned repository will contain only a subset
of the changesets of the source repository. Only the set of changesets
defined by all \-r/\-\-rev options (including all their ancestors)
will be pulled into the destination repository.
No subsequent changesets (including subsequent tags) will be present
in the destination.
.sp
Using \-r/\-\-rev (or \(aqclone src#rev dest\(aq) implies \-\-pull, even for
local source repositories.
.sp
For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever the source
and destination are on the same filesystem (note this applies only
to the repository data, not to the working directory). Some
filesystems, such as AFS, implement hardlinking incorrectly, but
do not report errors. In these cases, use the \-\-pull option to
avoid hardlinking.
.sp
In some cases, you can clone repositories and the working directory
using full hardlinks with
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ cp \-al REPO REPOCLONE
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This is the fastest way to clone, but it is not always safe. The
operation is not atomic (making sure REPO is not modified during
the operation is up to you) and you have to make sure your editor
breaks hardlinks (Emacs and most Linux Kernel tools do so). Also,
this is not compatible with certain extensions that place their
metadata under the .hg directory, such as mq.
.sp
Mercurial will update the working directory to the first applicable
revision from this list:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP a. 3
.
null if \-U or the source repository has no changesets
.IP b. 3
.
if \-u . and the source repository is local, the first parent of
the source repository\(aqs working directory
.IP c. 3
.
the changeset specified with \-u (if a branch name, this means the
latest head of that branch)
.IP d. 3
.

.sp
Commit changes to the given files into the repository. Unlike a
centralized RCS, this operation is a local operation. See hg push
for a way to actively distribute your changes.
.sp
If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by "hg status"
will be committed.
.sp
If you are committing the result of a merge, do not provide any
filenames or \-I/\-X filters.
.sp
If no commit message is specified, the configured editor is
started to prompt you for a message.

.sp
Mark dest as having copies of source files. If dest is a
directory, copies are put in that directory. If dest is a file,
the source must be a single file.
.sp
By default, this command copies the contents of files as they
exist in the working directory. If invoked with \-A/\-\-after, the
operation is recorded, but no copying is performed.
.sp
This command takes effect with the next commit. To undo a copy
before that, see hg revert.

.B \fBdiff [OPTION]... ([\-c REV] | [\-r REV1 [\-r REV2]]) [FILE]...\fP
.sp
Show differences between revisions for the specified files.
.sp
Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.
.sp
NOTE: diff may generate unexpected results for merges, as it will
default to comparing against the working directory\(aqs first parent
changeset if no revisions are specified.
.sp
When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown
between those revisions. If only one revision is specified then
that revision is compared to the working directory, and, when no
revisions are specified, the working directory files are compared
to its parent.
.sp
Alternatively you can specify \-c/\-\-change with a revision to see
the changes in that changeset relative to its first parent.
.sp
Without the \-a/\-\-text option, diff will avoid generating diffs of
files it detects as binary. With \-a, diff will generate a diff
anyway, probably with undesirable results.
.sp
Use the \-g/\-\-git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff
format. For more information, read \(aqhg help diffs\(aq.

The information shown in the changeset header is: author, date,
branch name (if non\-default), changeset hash, parent(s) and commit
comment.
.sp
NOTE: export may generate unexpected diff output for merge
changesets, as it will compare the merge changeset against its

Without the \-a/\-\-text option, export will avoid generating diffs
of files it detects as binary. With \-a, export will generate a
diff anyway, probably with undesirable results.
.sp
Use the \-g/\-\-git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff
format. See \(aqhg help diffs\(aq for more information.
.sp
With the \-\-switch\-parent option, the diff will be against the

Search revisions of files for a regular expression.

This command behaves differently than Unix grep. It only accepts

.sp
By default, grep only prints output for the first revision of a
file in which it finds a match. To get it to print every revision
that contains a change in match status ("\-" for a match that
becomes a non\-match, or "+" for a non\-match that becomes a match),
use the \-\-all flag.

.sp
With no arguments, show all repository branch heads.
.sp
Repository "heads" are changesets with no child changesets. They are
where development generally takes place and are the usual targets
for update and merge operations. Branch heads are changesets that have
no child changeset on the same branch.
.sp
If one or more REVs are given, only branch heads on the branches
associated with the specified changesets are shown.
.sp
If \-c/\-\-closed is specified, also show branch heads marked closed
(see hg commit \-\-close\-branch).
.sp
If STARTREV is specified, only those heads that are descendants of
STARTREV will be displayed.

.sp
Import a list of patches and commit them individually (unless
\-\-no\-commit is specified).
.sp
If there are outstanding changes in the working directory, import
will abort unless given the \-f/\-\-force flag.
.sp
You can import a patch straight from a mail message. Even patches
as attachments work (to use the body part, it must have type
text/plain or text/x\-patch). From and Subject headers of email
message are used as default committer and commit message. All
text/plain body parts before first diff are added to commit
message.
.sp
If the imported patch was generated by hg export, user and
description from patch override values from message headers and
body. Values given on command line with \-m/\-\-message and \-u/\-\-user
override these.
.sp
If \-\-exact is specified, import will set the working directory to
the parent of each patch before applying it, and will abort if the
resulting changeset has a different ID than the one recorded in
the patch. This may happen due to character set problems or other
deficiencies in the text patch format.
.sp
With \-s/\-\-similarity, hg will attempt to discover renames and
copies in the patch in the same way as \(aqaddremove\(aq.
.sp
To read a patch from standard input, use "\-" as the patch name. If
a URL is specified, the patch will be downloaded from it.

File history is shown without following rename or copy history of
files. Use \-f/\-\-follow with a filename to follow history across
renames and copies. \-\-follow without a filename will only show
ancestors or descendants of the starting revision. \-\-follow\-first
only follows the first parent of merge revisions.
.sp
If no revision range is specified, the default is \%tip:0\: unless
\-\-follow is set, in which case the working directory parent is

.B \fBrevert [OPTION]... [\-r REV] [NAME]...\fP
.sp
(Use update \-r to check out earlier revisions, revert does not
change the working directory parents.)
.sp
With no revision specified, revert the named files or directories
to the contents they had in the parent of the working directory.
This restores the contents of the affected files to an unmodified
state and unschedules adds, removes, copies, and renames. If the
working directory has two parents, you must explicitly specify a
revision.
.sp
Using the \-r/\-\-rev option, revert the given files or directories
to their contents as of a specific revision. This can be helpful
to "roll back" some or all of an earlier change. See \(aqhg help
dates\(aq for a list of formats valid for \-d/\-\-date.
.sp
Revert modifies the working directory. It does not commit any
changes, or change the parent of the working directory. If you
revert to a revision other than the parent of the working
directory, the reverted files will thus appear modified
afterwards.
.sp
If a file has been deleted, it is restored. If the executable mode
of a file was changed, it is reset.

If names are given, all files matching the names are reverted.
If no arguments are given, no files are reverted.

.B \fBrollback\fP
.sp
This command should be used with care. There is only one level of
rollback, and there is no way to undo a rollback. It will also
restore the dirstate at the time of the last transaction, losing
any dirstate changes since that time. This command does not alter
the working directory.
.sp
Transactions are used to encapsulate the effects of all commands
that create new changesets or propagate existing changesets into a
repository. For example, the following commands are transactional,
and their effects can be rolled back:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
commit
.IP \(bu 2
.
import
.IP \(bu 2
.
pull
.IP \(bu 2
.
push (with this repository as the destination)
.IP \(bu 2
.
unbundle
.UNINDENT
.sp
This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once
changes are visible for pull by other users, rolling a transaction
back locally is ineffective (someone else may already have pulled
the changes). Furthermore, a race is possible with readers of the
repository; for example an in\-progress pull from the repository
may fail if a rollback is performed.

Start a local HTTP repository browser and pull server. You can use
this for ad\-hoc sharing and browing of repositories. It is
recommended to use a real web server to serve a repository for
longer periods of time.
.sp
Please note that the server does not implement access control.
This means that, by default, anybody can read from the server and
nobody can write to it by default. Set the \fBweb.allow_push\fP
option to \fB*\fP to allow everybody to push to the server. You
should use a real web server if you need to authenticate users.

\-c/\-\-clean, \-i/\-\-ignored, \-C/\-\-copies or \-A/\-\-all are given.
Unless options described with "show only ..." are given, the
options \-mardu are used.
.sp
Option \-q/\-\-quiet hides untracked (unknown and ignored) files
unless explicitly requested with \-u/\-\-unknown or \-i/\-\-ignored.
.sp
NOTE: status may appear to disagree with diff if permissions have
changed or a merge has occurred. The standard diff format does not
report permission changes and diff only reports changes relative
to one merge parent.
.sp
If one revision is given, it is used as the base revision.
If two revisions are given, the differences between them are
shown. The \-\-change option can also be used as a shortcut to list
the changed files of a revision from its first parent.

very useful to compare different revisions, to go back to significant
earlier versions or to mark branch points as releases, etc.
.sp
If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is
used, or tip if no revision is checked out.
.sp
To facilitate version control, distribution, and merging of tags,
they are stored as a file named ".hgtags" which is managed
similarly to other project files and can be hand\-edited if
necessary. The file \(aq.hg/localtags\(aq is used for local tags (not

The configuration files for Mercurial use a simple ini\-file format. A
configuration file consists of sections, led by a \fB[section]\fP header
and followed by \fBname = value\fP entries:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[ui]
username = Firstname Lastname <firstname.lastname@example.net>
verbose = True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This above entries will be referred to as \fBui.username\fP and
\fBui.verbose\fP, respectively. Please see the hgrc man page for a full
description of the possible configuration values:

.SH DATE FORMATS
.sp
Some commands allow the user to specify a date, e.g.:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
backout, commit, import, tag: Specify the commit date.
.IP \(bu 2
.
log, revert, update: Select revision(s) by date.

Lastly, there is Mercurial\(aqs internal format:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB1165432709 0\fP (Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 UTC)
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is the internal representation format for dates. unixtime is the
number of seconds since the epoch (1970\-01\-01 00:00 UTC). offset is
the offset of the local timezone, in seconds west of UTC (negative if
the timezone is east of UTC).
.sp
The log command also accepts date ranges:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB<{datetime}\fP \- at or before a given date/time
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB>{datetime}\fP \- on or after a given date/time
.IP \(bu 2

\fB{datetime} to {datetime}\fP \- a date range, inclusive
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB\-{days}\fP \- within a given number of days of today
.UNINDENT
.SH FILE NAME PATTERNS
.sp
Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more files
at a time.
.sp
By default, Mercurial treats filenames as shell\-style extended glob
patterns.
.sp
Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.
.sp
To use a plain path name without any pattern matching, start it with
\fBpath:\fP. These path names must completely match starting at the
current repository root.
.sp
To use an extended glob, start a name with \fBglob:\fP. Globs are rooted
at the current directory; a glob such as \fB*.c\fP will only match files
in the current directory ending with \fB.c\fP.
.sp
The supported glob syntax extensions are \fB**\fP to match any string
across path separators and \fB{a,b}\fP to mean "a or b".
.sp
To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with \fBre:\fP.
Regexp pattern matching is anchored at the root of the repository.
.sp
Plain examples:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
path:foo/bar   a name bar in a directory named foo in the root
               of the repository
path:path:name a file or directory named "path:name"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Glob examples:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
glob:*.c       any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
*.c            any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
**.c           any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of the
               current directory including itself.
foo/*.c        any name ending in ".c" in the directory foo
foo/**.c       any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of foo
               including itself.
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Regexp examples:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
re:.*\e.c$      any name ending in ".c", anywhere in the repository
.ft P
.fi
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B HG
.
Path to the \(aqhg\(aq executable, automatically passed when running
hooks, extensions or external tools. If unset or empty, this is
the hg executable\(aqs name if it\(aqs frozen, or an executable named
\(aqhg\(aq (with %PATHEXT% [defaulting to COM/EXE/BAT/CMD] extensions on
Windows) is searched.
.TP
.B HGEDITOR
.
This is the name of the editor to run when committing. See EDITOR.
.sp
(deprecated, use .hgrc)
.TP
.B HGENCODING
.
This overrides the default locale setting detected by Mercurial.
This setting is used to convert data including usernames,
changeset descriptions, tag names, and branches. This setting can
be overridden with the \-\-encoding command\-line option.
.TP
.B HGENCODINGMODE
.
This sets Mercurial\(aqs behavior for handling unknown characters
while transcoding user input. The default is "strict", which
causes Mercurial to abort if it can\(aqt map a character. Other
settings include "replace", which replaces unknown characters, and
"ignore", which drops them. This setting can be overridden with
the \-\-encodingmode command\-line option.
.TP
.B HGMERGE
.
An executable to use for resolving merge conflicts. The program
will be executed with three arguments: local file, remote file,
ancestor file.
.sp
(deprecated, use .hgrc)
.TP
.B HGRCPATH
.
A list of files or directories to search for hgrc files. Item
separator is ":" on Unix, ";" on Windows. If HGRCPATH is not set,
platform default search path is used. If empty, only the .hg/hgrc
from the current repository is read.
.sp
For each element in HGRCPATH:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
if it\(aqs a directory, all files ending with .rc are added
.IP \(bu 2
.
otherwise, the file itself will be added
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B HGPLAIN
.
When set, this disables any options in .hgrc that might change
Mercurial\(aqs default output. This includes encoding, defaults,
verbose mode, debug mode, quiet mode, tracebacks, and
localization. This can be useful when scripting against Mercurial
in the face of existing user configuration.
.sp
Equivalent options set via command line flags or environment
variables are not overridden.
.TP
.B HGUSER
.
This is the string used as the author of a commit. If not set,
available values will be considered in this order:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
HGUSER (deprecated)
.IP \(bu 2
.
hgrc files from the HGRCPATH
.IP \(bu 2

.TP
.B VISUAL
.
This is the name of the editor to use when committing. See EDITOR.
.TP
.B EDITOR
.
Sometimes Mercurial needs to open a text file in an editor for a
user to modify, for example when writing commit messages. The
editor it uses is determined by looking at the environment
variables HGEDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR, in that order. The first
non\-empty one is chosen. If all of them are empty, the editor
defaults to \(aqvi\(aq.
.TP
.B PYTHONPATH
.
This is used by Python to find imported modules and may need to be
set appropriately if this Mercurial is not installed system\-wide.
.UNINDENT
.SH SPECIFYING SINGLE REVISIONS
.sp
Mercurial supports several ways to specify individual revisions.
.sp
A plain integer is treated as a revision number. Negative integers are
treated as sequential offsets from the tip, with \-1 denoting the tip,
\-2 denoting the revision prior to the tip, and so forth.
.sp
A 40\-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision
identifier.
.sp
A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as a
unique revision identifier and is referred to as a short\-form
identifier. A short\-form identifier is only valid if it is the prefix
of exactly one full\-length identifier.
.sp
Any other string is treated as a tag or branch name. A tag name is a
symbolic name associated with a revision identifier. A branch name
denotes the tipmost revision of that branch. Tag and branch names must
not contain the ":" character.
.sp
The reserved name "tip" is a special tag that always identifies the
most recent revision.
.sp
The reserved name "null" indicates the null revision. This is the
revision of an empty repository, and the parent of revision 0.
.sp
The reserved name "." indicates the working directory parent. If no
working directory is checked out, it is equivalent to null. If an
uncommitted merge is in progress, "." is the revision of the first
parent.
.SH SPECIFYING MULTIPLE REVISIONS
.sp
When Mercurial accepts more than one revision, they may be specified
individually, or provided as a topologically continuous range,
separated by the ":" character.
.sp
The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where BEGIN and END are
revision identifiers. Both BEGIN and END are optional. If BEGIN is not
specified, it defaults to revision number 0. If END is not specified,
it defaults to the tip. The range ":" thus means "all revisions".
.sp
If BEGIN is greater than END, revisions are treated in reverse order.
.sp
A range acts as a closed interval. This means that a range of 3:5
gives 3, 4 and 5. Similarly, a range of 9:6 gives 9, 8, 7, and 6.
.SH DIFF FORMATS
.sp
Mercurial\(aqs default format for showing changes between two versions of
a file is compatible with the unified format of GNU diff, which can be
used by GNU patch and many other standard tools.
.sp
While this standard format is often enough, it does not encode the
following information:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
executable status and other permission bits
.IP \(bu 2
.
copy or rename information
.IP \(bu 2
.
changes in binary files
.IP \(bu 2
.
creation or deletion of empty files
.UNINDENT
.sp
Mercurial also supports the extended diff format from the git VCS
which addresses these limitations. The git diff format is not produced
by default because a few widespread tools still do not understand this
format.
.sp
This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial repository
(e.g. with "hg export"), you should be careful about things like file
copies and renames or other things mentioned above, because when
applying a standard diff to a different repository, this extra
information is lost. Mercurial\(aqs internal operations (like push and
pull) are not affected by this, because they use an internal binary
format for communicating changes.
.sp
To make Mercurial produce the git extended diff format, use the \-\-git
option available for many commands, or set \(aqgit = True\(aq in the [diff]
section of your hgrc. You do not need to set this option when
importing diffs in this format or using them in the mq extension.
.SH TEMPLATE USAGE
.sp
Mercurial allows you to customize output of commands through
templates. You can either pass in a template from the command
line, via the \-\-template option, or select an existing
template\-style (\-\-style).
.sp
You can customize output for any "log\-like" command: log,
outgoing, incoming, tip, parents, heads and glog.
.sp
Four styles are packaged with Mercurial: default (the style used
when no explicit preference is passed), compact, changelog,
and xml.
Usage:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg log \-r1 \-\-style changelog
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A template is a piece of text, with markup to invoke variable
expansion:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg log \-r1 \-\-template "{node}\en"
b56ce7b07c52de7d5fd79fb89701ea538af65746
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Strings in curly braces are called keywords. The availability of
keywords depends on the exact context of the templater. These
keywords are usually available for templating a log\-like command:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B author
.
String. The unmodified author of the changeset.
.TP
.B branches
.
String. The name of the branch on which the changeset was
committed. Will be empty if the branch name was default.

.
Date information. The date when the changeset was committed.
.TP
.B desc
.
String. The text of the changeset description.
.TP
.B diffstat
.
String. Statistics of changes with the following format:
"modified files: +added/\-removed lines"
.TP
.B files
.
List of strings. All files modified, added, or removed by this
changeset.
.TP
.B file_adds

Integer. The repository\-local changeset revision number.
.TP
.B tags

List of strings. Any tags associated with the changeset.
.TP
.B latesttag
.
String. Most recent global tag in the ancestors of this
changeset.
.TP
.B latesttagdistance
.
Integer. Longest path to the latest tag.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The "date" keyword does not produce human\-readable output. If you
want to use a date in your output, you can use a filter to process
it. Filters are functions which return a string based on the input
variable. Be sure to use the stringify filter first when you\(aqre
applying a string\-input filter to a list\-like input variable.
You can also use a chain of filters to get the desired output:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg tip \-\-template "{date|isodate}\en"
2008\-08\-21 18:22 +0000
.ft P
.fi
.sp

.UNINDENT
.SH URL PATHS
.sp
Valid URLs are of the form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
local/filesystem/path[#revision]
file://local/filesystem/path[#revision]
http://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
ssh://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Paths in the local filesystem can either point to Mercurial
repositories or to bundle files (as created by \(aqhg bundle\(aq or \(aqhg
incoming \-\-bundle\(aq).
.sp
An optional identifier after # indicates a particular branch, tag, or
changeset to use from the remote repository. See also \(aqhg help
revisions\(aq.
.sp
Some features, such as pushing to \%http://\: and \%https://\: URLs are only
possible if the feature is explicitly enabled on the remote Mercurial
server.
.sp
Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination machine
and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with as remotecmd.
.IP \(bu 2
.
path is relative to the remote user\(aqs home directory by default. Use
an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ssh://example.com//tmp/repository
.ft P
.fi
.IP \(bu 2
.
Mercurial doesn\(aqt use its own compression via SSH; the right thing
to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com
  Compression no
Host *
  Compression yes
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Alternatively specify "ssh \-C" as your ssh command in your hgrc or
with the \-\-ssh command line option.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These URLs can all be stored in your hgrc with path aliases under the
[paths] section like so:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[paths]
alias1 = URL1
alias2 = URL2
\&...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can then use the alias for any command that uses a URL (for
example \(aqhg pull alias1\(aq will be treated as \(aqhg pull URL1\(aq).
.sp
Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults when
you do not provide the URL to a command:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B default:
.
When you create a repository with hg clone, the clone command saves
the location of the source repository as the new repository\(aqs
\(aqdefault\(aq path. This is then used when you omit path from push\- and
pull\-like commands (including incoming and outgoing).
.TP
.B default\-push:
.
The push command will look for a path named \(aqdefault\-push\(aq, and
prefer it over \(aqdefault\(aq if both are defined.
.UNINDENT
.SH USING ADDITIONAL FEATURES
.sp
Mercurial has the ability to add new features through the use of
extensions. Extensions may add new commands, add options to
existing commands, change the default behavior of commands, or
implement hooks.
.sp
Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of reasons:
they can increase startup overhead; they may be meant for advanced
usage only; they may provide potentially dangerous abilities (such
as letting you destroy or modify history); they might not be ready
for prime time; or they may alter some usual behaviors of stock
Mercurial. It is thus up to the user to activate extensions as
needed.
.sp
To enable the "foo" extension, either shipped with Mercurial or in
the Python search path, create an entry for it in your hgrc, like
this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[extensions]
foo =
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You may also specify the full path to an extension:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[extensions]
myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To explicitly disable an extension enabled in an hgrc of broader
scope, prepend its path with !:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[extensions]
# disabling extension bar residing in /path/to/extension/bar.py
bar = !/path/to/extension/bar.py
# ditto, but no path was supplied for extension baz
baz = !
.ft P
.fi
.sp
